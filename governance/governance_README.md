# Governance Layer — LTV Protocol

Institutional Trust, Transparency, and Policy Infrastructure  
for the LTV Protocol Standard Draft

---

## 1. Purpose

The Governance Layer defines the institutional trust framework supporting the LTV Protocol.

While the OpenAPI specifications describe computational and routing interfaces, this layer establishes the policy, auditability, and lifecycle controls required for adoption in regulated, financial, and agentic commerce environments.

This includes:

- Identity trust lifecycle
- Policy transparency
- Routing governance
- Incident response
- Institutional verification surfaces

---

## 2. Scope

The Governance Layer applies to all protocol surfaces where value computation, identity assertion, or routing prioritization may affect financial, commercial, or agentic decision systems.

Key domains:

- Lifetime Value prediction trustworthiness
- Signal privacy compliance
- Identity certificate validity
- Routing weight neutrality
- Governance policy versioning

---

## 3. Architectural Position

Protocol stack positioning:

Application / Agent Layer  
↓  
Routing & Value Orchestration  
↓  
LTV Protocol (Computation Layer)  
↓  
Governance Layer (Trust & Policy)  
↓  
Identity & Transparency Infrastructure  

The Governance Layer does not execute value computation.  
It ensures that such computation remains auditable, explainable, and institutionally trustworthy.

## 4. Governance Artifacts

This directory contains policy and institutional trust documents, including but not limited to:

- Governance patch specifications
- Transparency log records
- Policy version histories
- Identity trust lifecycle definitions
- Incident disclosures (if applicable)

Example artifact types:

- ltv-protocol-v1.1-alpha-governance-patch.docx  
- transparency-log.md  
- policy-version-ledger.md  

---

## 5. Policy Transparency Model

Routing and value-weight policies are governed through:

- Versioned policy documents
- Public policy hash commitments
- Change-reason disclosures
- Effective date declarations

This ensures that no unilateral or undisclosed routing manipulation can occur without traceability.

---

## 6. Identity Trust & Revocation

The Governance Layer defines lifecycle controls for protocol identity credentials, including:

- Key rotation frameworks
- Certificate revocation mechanisms
- Compromise response procedures
- Trust chain continuity requirements

These controls are critical for institutional and exchange-grade deployments.

---

## 7. Privacy & Signal Compliance

Signal ingestion policies enforce:

- Derived-data-only inputs
- Prohibition of raw personally identifiable information (PII)
- Schema-bound signal submission
- Auditability of signal provenance

This enables compatibility with global privacy frameworks, including GDPR and CCPA environments.

---

## 8. Transparency & Auditability

Governance artifacts are structured to support:

- Institutional due diligence
- Regulatory audit review
- Agentic trust validation
- Cross-network interoperability assessments

Where applicable, policy hashes may be committed to public transparency logs or verifiable ledgers.

---

## 9. Status

Governance specifications are currently in Draft (Alpha) status and are subject to institutional review, consortium input, and implementation testing.

---

## 10. Positioning Statement

The LTV Protocol Governance Layer provides:

Canonical trust definitions  
Policy transparency infrastructure  
Routing neutrality safeguards  
Identity lifecycle governance  

It functions as the institutional assurance surface enabling LTV computation to operate as a credible financial and agentic decision primitive.
