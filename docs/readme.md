# LTV Protocol — Documentation Hub

Welcome to the official documentation index of the **LTV Protocol**.

This documentation directory defines the conceptual foundations, delegation infrastructure, signal intelligence systems, and execution environments that position LTV as a canonical value‑intelligence layer within agentic commerce and autonomous economic coordination.

---

# 1. Documentation Architecture

The LTV Protocol documentation is structured across four primary layers:

1. **Conceptual Foundations** → Why LTV exists as infrastructure
2. **Delegation Infrastructure** → How authority moves from humans to agents
3. **Signal & Oracle Systems** → How value is computed and standardized
4. **Execution Environment** → How decisions operate in real‑time systems

---

# 2. Conceptual Foundations

Defines the philosophical, economic, and research grounding of the protocol.

## 2.1 SPEC — Conceptual Origin

**File:** `/docs/SPEC_Conceptual_Origin.md`

Establishes the theoretical origin of the LTV Protocol.

Key areas:

* Heterogeneous signal compatibility model
* Economic value abstraction
* Canonical signal standardization
* Positioning LTV beyond marketing analytics

This document functions as the protocol’s conceptual root specification.

---

## 2.2 Research Context

**File:** `/docs/research-context.md`

Provides academic and industry grounding.

Includes references across:

* Agentic commerce infrastructure
* Payment orchestration systems
* AI economic coordination
* Autonomous decision environments

Positions the LTV Protocol within broader research and infrastructure discourse.

---

# 3. Delegation Infrastructure

Defines how economic decision authority is delegated from humans to AI agents.

## 3.1 LTV Delegation Stack

**File:** `/docs/ltv_delegation_stack_doc.md`

Architectural framework describing delegated economic execution.

Layers include:

* Human intent origination
* Agent interface systems
* Decision engines
* LTV value oracle integration
* Payment and execution rails

Positions LTV as the canonical value signal guiding delegated commerce.

---

## 3.2 Delegation Alignment

**File:** `/docs/delegation-alignment.md`

Governance and safety framework operating on top of the Delegation Stack.

Defines:

* Incentive alignment models
* Capital authorization constraints
* Risk boundaries
* Ethical and fiduciary safeguards

Ensures delegated agents operate within aligned economic and governance parameters.

---

# 4. Signal & Oracle Systems

Defines how economic value signals are ingested, processed, and standardized.

## 4.1 Signal Ingestion & Oracle Integration

**File:** `/docs/signal-ingestion-oracle-integration.md`

Reference architecture for transforming raw data into machine‑readable value signals.

Covers:

* Multi‑source signal ingestion
* Data normalization pipelines
* Oracle computation frameworks
* Value scoring standardization

Forms the data‑to‑value conversion layer of the protocol.

---

# 5. Execution Environment

Defines the operational constraints affecting delegated economic systems.

## 5.1 Latency & Real‑Time Coupling Clarification

**File:** `/docs/latency-real-time-coupling-clarification.md`

Explores how execution latency impacts agent decision systems.

Key topics:

* Real‑time payment authorization coupling
* Decision‑execution synchronization
* Infrastructure response constraints
* Economic timing dependencies

Defines the execution physics governing autonomous transactions.

---

# 6. Reading Path

Suggested navigation order:

1. SPEC — Conceptual Origin
2. Research Context
3. Delegation Stack
4. Delegation Alignment
5. Signal Ingestion & Oracle Integration
6. Latency & Real‑Time Coupling

This sequence moves from theory → delegation → signal infrastructure → execution environment.

---

# 7. Canonical Positioning

Within the agentic commerce stack, the LTV Protocol defines:

* The value‑intelligence layer
* The economic routing signal
* The delegation authorization primitive
* The retention‑weighted capital allocation model

This transforms LTV from a marketing metric into programmable economic infrastructure.
