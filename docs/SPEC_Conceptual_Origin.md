# Conceptual Origin

## Research Background

This specification is informed by broader research into value intelligence infrastructure and agent commerce stack design.

## Positioning

The LTV Protocol draft specification should be viewed as an exploratory interface model aligned with the conceptual architecture described in the research article above.

It focuses on:

- Predictive value signal interfaces  
- Routing weight abstraction  
- Priority tier modeling  
- Governance and transparency surfaces  

Rather than functioning as a vertical execution protocol, the specification proposes an interoperability layer for economic value intelligence within agent-mediated transaction environments.

## Data Provenance & Signal Origination

The LTV Protocol operates as a value signal exchange and routing interface layer and does not require direct ownership or ingestion of raw transactional datasets.

Predictive value signals may originate from a variety of upstream computational environments, including but not limited to:

- Payment processing networks  
- Subscription and commerce platforms  
- Merchant-operated analytics systems  
- Credit underwriting infrastructures  
- Risk and fraud intelligence providers  
- Independent value prediction oracles  

The protocol standardizes the schema, attribution context, and routing semantics of predictive value outputs, rather than the methodologies used to derive them.

This architecture preserves institutional model sovereignty while enabling interoperable economic signaling across agent-mediated transaction ecosystems.

As such, the LTV Protocol should be understood as an interface abstraction layer situated downstream of value computation and upstream of routing and orchestration systems.

## Heterogeneous Signal Compatibility

The LTV primitive manifests across multiple financial and economic systems, including collateral leverage ratios in decentralized finance and lifetime value forecasting in commerce intelligence environments.

The LTV Protocol supports heterogeneous value signals, including Loan-to-Value ratios from DeFi oracles and Lifetime Value estimates from commerce intelligence systems.

Rather than competing with vertical implementations, the protocol provides an interoperability interface through which distinct instantiations of the LTV primitive can be contextualized, normalized, and routed across agent economic infrastructures.

This layered compatibility model allows capital leverage signals, underwriting metrics, and predictive commerce value models to coexist within a unified economic routing surface.
