# LTV Protocol — Documentation Hub

Welcome to the official documentation index of the **LTV Protocol**.

This directory defines the architectural, economic, and governance frameworks that position LTV as a canonical value‑intelligence layer within agentic commerce and autonomous economic systems.

---

# 1. Documentation Structure

The LTV Protocol documentation is organized across three primary layers:

- **Delegation Infrastructure** → How decision authority moves from humans to agents  
- **Value Intelligence Layer** → How economic value is measured and routed  
- **Specification Layer** → How systems integrate programmatically  

---

# 2. Delegation Infrastructure

Frameworks defining how AI agents receive, execute, and govern economic authority.

## 2.1 Delegation Stack
**File:** `/docs/delegation-stack.md`

Defines the architectural layers enabling economic decision delegation:

- Human intent origination
- Agent interfaces
- Decision engines
- LTV value oracles
- Payment execution rails

Positions LTV as the canonical signal within delegated commerce.

---

## 2.2 Delegation Alignment
**File:** `/docs/delegation-alignment.md`

Governance and safety framework operating on top of the Delegation Stack.

Defines:

- Incentive alignment models
- Risk boundaries
- Capital authorization logic
- Ethical and fiduciary constraints

Ensures delegated agents act within economically aligned parameters.

---

## 2.3 Delegation Levels
**File:** `/docs/delegation-levels.md`

Evolution model describing the progression of agent autonomy:

- Level 0 — Manual execution
- Level 1 — Assisted decisioning
- Level 2 — Conditional autonomy
- Level 3 — Economic autonomy
- Level 4 — Networked agent economies

Provides a maturity framework for agent deployment.

---

# 3. Value Intelligence Layer

Defines how value signals are computed, standardized, and utilized.

## 3.1 Value Routing
**File:** `/docs/value-routing.md`

Specifies how LTV scores function as routing weights across:

- Commerce orchestration
- Capital allocation
- Vendor prioritization
- Retention optimization

Positions LTV as a machine‑readable economic routing primitive.

---

## 3.2 LTV Oracle Specification
**File:** `/docs/oracle-spec.md`

Technical and conceptual framework for value computation.

Includes:

- Lifetime value scoring models
- Retention forecasting
- Margin projections
- Behavioral weighting inputs

Defines how raw data becomes standardized LTV signals.

---

# 4. Specification Layer

Integration frameworks enabling systems and agents to access LTV infrastructure.

## 4.1 OpenAPI Specification
**Path:** `/openapi/`

Machine‑readable interface definitions for:

- LTV scoring endpoints
- Routing queries
- Value authorization calls

Forms the executable interface layer of the protocol.

---

## 4.2 Agent Routing & Economic Calls
**Related Docs & Schemas**

Supports:

- Multi‑agent coordination
- Economic decision weighting
- Delegated payment authorization

Extends the OpenAPI layer into agent‑to‑agent commerce.

# 5. How to Navigate This Documentation

Suggested reading order:

1. Delegation Stack → Understand system architecture
2. Delegation Alignment → Understand governance constraints
3. Delegation Levels → Understand autonomy maturity
4. Value Routing → Understand economic flow logic
5. Oracle Specification → Understand value computation
6. OpenAPI Spec → Implement integrations

---

# 6. Canonical Positioning

Within the agentic commerce infrastructure stack, the LTV Protocol defines:

- The value‑intelligence layer
- The economic routing signal
- The delegation authorization primitive

This transforms LTV from a marketing metric into programmable economic infrastructure.
