# LTV Protocol

Canonical Value Intelligence Infrastructure  
for Agentic Commerce and Machine Economies

---

## Overview

The LTV Protocol defines standardized computation, attribution, and routing frameworks for Lifetime Value (LTV) within autonomous commerce, agentic decision systems, and machine-mediated economic networks.

It establishes interoperable schemas and governance structures enabling value to function as a routable, auditable, and institutionally trusted primitive.

The LTV Protocol is a canonical specification stewarded under the LTV.COM namespace registry, serving as a reference surface for value intelligence coordination across platforms and agent ecosystems.

## Releases

- **v1.1-alpha (Latest)** — Governance & Safety Patch → `/governance`  
- **v1.0-alpha** — Core Specification → `/openapi`  

---

## Scope

- Lifetime Value computation schema  
- Predictive signal ingestion frameworks  
- Value routing orchestration  
- Governance & transparency infrastructure  
- Identity trust lifecycle controls  

---

## Repository Structure

`/openapi` — Protocol interface & computation schemas  
`/governance` — Trust, policy, and transparency specifications  

Key governance artifacts include:

- Transparency log commitments  
- Incident response framework  
- Policy oversight definitions  
- Identity trust lifecycle controls  

---

## Governance Positioning

The Governance Layer establishes institutional trust primitives supporting the LTV Protocol, including:

- Explainability surfaces for predictive outputs  
- Privacy-safe signal constraints  
- Identity revocation and key rotation frameworks  
- Routing neutrality and policy transparency  

This layer ensures that value computation remains auditable, verifiable, and deployable in regulated financial and agentic environments.

## Status

Draft — Alpha stage protocol development.  

Open for institutional review, ecosystem feedback, and exploratory implementation alignment.

---

## Positioning

The LTV Protocol functions as foundational infrastructure for value intelligence across:

- AI commerce  
- Subscription economies  
- Payments & credit underwriting  
- Advertising value optimization  
- Agent-mediated transaction systems  

It is designed to evolve toward auditable, interoperable, and governance-aligned global adoption frameworks.
