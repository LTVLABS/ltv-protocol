# LTV Protocol

Canonical Value Intelligence Infrastructure  
for Agentic Commerce and Machine Economies

---

## Overview

The LTV Protocol defines standardized computation, attribution, and routing frameworks for Lifetime Value (LTV) within autonomous commerce, agentic decision systems, and machine-mediated economic networks.

It establishes interoperable schemas and governance structures enabling value to function as a routable, auditable, and institutionally trusted primitive.
